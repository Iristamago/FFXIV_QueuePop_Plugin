# FFXIV_QueuePop_Plugin


## What is FFXIV_QueuePop_Plugin?
FFXIV_QueuePop_Plugin (FFXIVQP) is a plugin for Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) that sends you a notification on Telegram when a FFXIV duty is found. **FREEDOM!!!**. 

## Who is this for?
Anyone who wants to toy around with it, have a go! Just a warning. It's unstable and should not be used without some modification.

## I don't have the API Key?

I set up a little server that handles the API calls with Telegram. I have no intention in sharing this with the public. It's super simple to set up yourself: [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). Use the GET function to call an URL.
